# Male-And-Female-Voice-Recognition
Signals And Systems Final Project

In this program, we first receive the voice and based on its data and using discrete fast Fourier transformation, we find the frequency and data "the reason for doing this is easier analysis of the sound in the frequency domain" and then the maximum value of power We find it from the power spectrum diagram and finally we find its frequency and we can find the speaker's gender according to the voice change interval which is different for men and women.
